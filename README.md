# frontend_prep
Originally: a repository to work with basic function to-dos to prepare for upcoming in-class assessment as a fellow. Set up a website to visually demonstrate functions.

Q4 2020: evolving into repository including JavaScript related lecture material for presentation in-class. 

Q1 2021: continuing to add lecture preparation material - now dividing into directories for module, changed name from js_prep to frontend_prep to reflect direction of repo

q2 2021: continuation of q1 2021- repository represents a wide body of lectures, activities, and otherwise from working with Codeup bootcamp students.
