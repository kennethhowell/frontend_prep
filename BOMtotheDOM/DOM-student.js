//i. locating in the DOM

// TODO: Find an element by the id of "hat-search". Store the result into a variable. Use a console log to check what is in your variable.

// TODO: Find all of our elements we made flex containers in Bootstrap! Locate the .d-flex class, store all of your results into a variable, and then console.log them.

// TODO: Finish my FOR loop to go through that variable containing our d-flex'ed items and console.log each individual one within the loop!

// for(var ; i < .length; ++){
// .. need to console.log some stuff!}

// TODO: Find all of our div elements and store them into a variable~! Console.log the variable to see the results within!

// TODO: Now that we have a variable with all of the elements, can you tell me how many divs are in the HTML using that variable and a little Javascript? Hint: the variable looks and behaves a lot like an array, doesn't it? That helped us in our for loop's condition!


// TODO BONUS (a): Write a function called locateDivs. When locateDivs is called, it should return a collection of the div elements found.

// TODO BONUS (b): Write a function called locateElements. locateElements should take in one parameter, the element to be searched for, and then return a collection of those elements. If no elements by that name were found, return false.

// ii. a step further: accessing / looking into what we've located deeper
